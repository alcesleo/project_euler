"""
The high limit of a billion left most of my early attempts dead in the
water as even an empty loop up to that number is slow. Fortunately, the
wikipedia page on Heronian Triangles **almost** has the answer, it's a really
simple formula but unfortunately generates (n-1, n, n+1) triangles rather than
the (n, n, nÂ±1) triangles we need.

A bit of experimentation shows that it can be adapted to do what we need, we just
need to alternatingly add or subtract 2 to n, and 1 to the last side of the triangle.

Turns out there are only 14 triangles that fit the requirements and it runs in 0.1s.
